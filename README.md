      <h1>ExerciseTracker</h1>
      <p>This is an application where I record exercise data focusing on building the app using the <strong>Repository Pattern</strong> and <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>. I will be using EF Core for the database backend, and will focus on only one type of exercise to keep the app simple.\n
And to illustrate the Separation of Concerns by the repository pattern, I created a class to replace Entity Framework by Dapper or in my repository. I notice didn't need to touch my controller class at all!.</p>
